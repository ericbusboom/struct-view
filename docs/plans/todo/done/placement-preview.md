# Placement preview before committing

The spec says shapes should preview before being committed to the model. Currently there is no preview.

- Show ghost/wireframe preview of the shape at its target position
- Preview updates as the user adjusts offset or count
- Confirm (Enter/click) commits the placement
- Cancel (Esc) discards the preview
