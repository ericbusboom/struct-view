# Equal-spacing placement: UI workflow

The `placeEqualSpacing` function exists but has no UI. Users need:

- A count input (how many copies) when placing a shape
- Visual preview of equally-spaced copies along the target edge
- The placed copies should merge coincident nodes automatically
- Result appears in the 3D model store
