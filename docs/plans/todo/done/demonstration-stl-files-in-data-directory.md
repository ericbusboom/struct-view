# Demonstration STL files in data directory

The `data/` directory now contains demonstration STL files (`Cabinet.stl`, `cube.stl`) that can be used for testing and demonstrating STL import, reference rendering, and snap-to-STL features in Sprint 003. These should be referenced in documentation and used as test fixtures when implementing STL-related functionality.
