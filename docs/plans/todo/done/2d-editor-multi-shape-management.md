# 2D Editor: Multi-shape management

The 2D editor currently only edits a single shape at a time. Users need to:

- Switch between multiple shapes in the editor (load from library, edit, save back)
- See a list of shapes and select which one to edit
- Create new shapes from scratch within the editor
- Clear the canvas to start a new shape without losing existing saved shapes
