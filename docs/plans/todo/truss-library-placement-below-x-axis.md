# Truss library shapes placed below x-axis and mostly off-screen

When creating a truss from the library in the 2D editor, the shape is placed below the x-axis when it should be entirely above it. The shape also ends up mostly off-screen, making it hard to see or interact with. The initial placement position needs to be corrected so the truss appears above the x-axis and within the visible canvas area.
