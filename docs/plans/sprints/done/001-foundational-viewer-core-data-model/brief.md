# Sprint 001 Brief

## Problem
There is currently no working StructView application to validate modeling concepts or data contracts.

## Solution
Build a minimal but real vertical slice: render a wireframe model in 3D and support basic node/member editing with JSON persistence.

## Success Criteria
- Interactive 3D viewport is operational.
- Node/member edits are reflected in model and rendering.
- Project data can be exported and imported as JSON.
- Tests cover schema validation and core edit operations.
